1.Data types in js
   primitive - string, bigint, undefined, null, symbol, number, boolean 
   non-primitive - object - store collection of data, multiple and complex 
   
   String: series of characters
           var str ="Vivek Obroyi";     var str2 ='Johnny';
   Number: decimal or non-decimal 
           var x=3;
   BogInt: store numbers above limitation of number data types
           var bigInteger = 3562377287788837468291982943434443334
   Boolean: logical entity, true or false, conditional testing 
            var a=2;  var b=4;  (a==b)    //returns false
   Undefined: declared but not assigned, undefined
            var x;    var y = undefined;
   Symbol: new datatype in ES6 version of js, store anoymous and unique value
           var symbol1 = Symbol('symbol');

2.Hoisting
   default behaviour of js where all variable and fns declarations are moved on top. 
   irrespective of where variables and fns are declared, moved on top of scope (local and global)
   Eg:  hoistedFunction();
        function hoistedFunction() {
            console.log("Hello world!");
        }   //"Hello world!"  even when fn declared after calling

3. == and ===
    Comparison Operators
    == compare values          === compare both values and types


4. Implicit Type Coercion 
     Automatic conversion of value from one data type to another when operands are of different data types
         String Coercion - while using the '+' operator.

5. Passed by value and passed by reference
    primitive are passed by value and non-primitive are passed by reference

6. Closures in js
    A fn that has access to parent scope, after parent fn has closed.

    function myCounter() {
          let counter = 0;
          return function() {
          counter++;
          return counter;
    };
  }
        const add = myCounter();
        add();
        add();
        add();
        <!-- counter is now 3 -->
